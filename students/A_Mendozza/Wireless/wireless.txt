OFDM --> Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexin. 

In 1999, the IEEE 802.11a is used to work with unlicensed 5 GHz band 

802.11a, the bandwidth of a channel is 20MHz
In OFDM is easly extend to use 40 MHz in 802.11n, 80 MHz and 160 MHz (802.11ac) channels



Which tools do you advice to collect wifi metrics? 


The last PHY: in 2003, the IEEE 802.11g introduced the Extended Rate PHY.   


Tools to measure wi-fi frequency 
WireShark 

Command line tools: 
$ cd /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources
$ ./airport -I

How the MAC layer work?
MAC has to share the Medium and transmitted frame, how the CSMA
